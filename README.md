# Salifort Motors HR Project: Machine Learning for Employee Retention

This project leverages machine learning to predict and understand employee attrition at Salifort Motors, aiming to reduce turnover costs and improve retention strategies.

## Project Overview

I engineered predictive models to identify employees at high risk of leaving the company ("flight-risk" employees). The goal was to provide Salifort Motors with actionable insights to proactively address attrition and improve employee retention.

## Key Achievements

* **Engineered predictive models** achieving **97% accuracy** (F1-score: 0.90) on a dataset of 15,000 employee records, effectively identifying flight-risk employees.
* **Implemented and compared multiple machine learning algorithms** including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost using `scikit-learn` to optimize prediction performance.
* **Conducted thorough feature importance analysis** to pinpoint key drivers of employee attrition, translating these findings into actionable recommendations.
* The generated insights and recommendations could potentially reduce turnover costs by an estimated 25%.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* `scikit-learn`
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
